MongoDB aggregation
===================
	Aggregation operations process data records and return computed results. 
    Aggregation operations group values from multiple documents together, and can 
    perform a variety of operations on the grouped data to return a single result. 
    MongoDB provides three ways to perform aggregation: 
	> aggregation pipeline
	> map-reduce function
	> single purpose aggregation methods

Aggregation Pipeline
====================
	MongoDBâ€™s aggregation framework is modeled on the concept of data processing pipelines. 
    Documents enter a multi-stage pipeline that transforms the documents into an aggregated 
    result. The most basic pipeline stages provide filters that operate like queries and 
    document transformations that modify the form of the output document. Other pipeline 
    operations provide tools for grouping and sorting documents by specific field or fields 
    as well as tools for aggregating the contents of arrays, including arrays of documents. 
    In addition, pipeline stages can use operators for tasks such as calculating the average
     or concatenating a string.
