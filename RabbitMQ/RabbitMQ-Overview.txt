RabbitMQ
----------
	- It is a message broker that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol(AMQP)
	- RabbitMQ standardizes the messaging by defining Producers, brokers and Consumers
	- Messaging increases the loose coupling and scalability.
	- A producer generates the message, but it does not directly iteracts with Queue. 
	Instead it uses an 'Exchange' that adds the message to the Queue. The consumer consumes the message from the queue.
	- An exchange connected to queue using a binding and binding key.
	- Producer uses and exchange key and the exchange compares it with binding key to forward the message to a queue.
	- There are different types of message forwarding systems
		- Fanout
		- Direct
		- Topic
		- Header
		- Default (nameless) exchange
	- In fanout the exchange broadcasts the message to all the queues.
	- In direct the exchange forward the message to one or more queues whose binding key matches the routing key.
	- A topic matches a partial key matching. eg: "red.*" matches to "red.green" and "red.blue".
	- Header uses the message header to forward the message to the queue instead of routing key.
	- The default (nameless) exchange uses the routing key that matches with the queue name.
